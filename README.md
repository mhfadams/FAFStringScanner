FAFStringScanner
================

A custom string scanner better suited to my parsing needs than NSScanner.


(This is also my first GitHub repository, so I'm practicing)


Development Note: This class must remain compatible with OS-X 10.4.


API is fairly stable, but following issues need attention:

- Creation of tests;
- Clarification of concept of 'currentChar' and the like;
- Testing and fixing of edge-cases/limits, such as at beginning of a string;
